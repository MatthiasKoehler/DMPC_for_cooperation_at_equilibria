# DMPC for cooperation at equilibria

This repository contains the code used in the simulation examples in 

M. Köhler, M. A. Müller, and F. Allgöwer, "Distributed MPC for Self-Organized Cooperation of Multi-Agent Systems,", 2024, IEEE Trans. Autom. Control, doi: 10.1109/TAC.2024.3407633

preprint available on arxiv. doi: 10.48550/arXiv.2210.10128

The code relies on CasADi (https://web.casadi.org/) which in turn uses Ipopt (https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/).

*The code in this repository was developed solely by the first author. The other authors of the associated publication were not involved in its implementation or maintenance and bear no responsibility for its correctness or completeness.*
